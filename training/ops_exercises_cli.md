# Operational Exercises with the Command-line Interface#

The following exercises use the command line interface to perform typical operations on a VoltDB database.  Unless specified otherwise, these commands will work on Community Edition or Enterprise Edition.

The commands can and should be organized into scripts to simplify and standardize the process of database operations.  Example scripts will be used in this exercise, and are also available for download.

Before getting started, create a directory for your scripts.  Since we'll be using application files that are provided in the examples/voter folder, it's convenient to create a directory under the examples folder, like this:

    mkdir ~/voltdb/examples/scripts
